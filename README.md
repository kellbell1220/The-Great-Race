# The-Great-Race
## Web Dev 2 Mid-Term Project

Assignment Details:

In this project, you will explore some of the topics discussed in class regarding the Browser Object Model, or Document Object Model.

You will implement a page that simulates a race between two or more competing players. For example, a tortoise racing a hare or spongebob racing squidward.

First, your page needs to display an image of something like a stop light. The stop light will either show a red light or a green light “lit”. When the page is loaded, it will show a red light “lit”. When the image is clicked the image displayed should change to a different image with the green light “lit”.  This indicates the start of the race, and the players should start racing.

The next part of the page that is significant is the characters participating in the race. These characters should initially be displayed on one side of the page. They each “run” to the finish line based on randomly generated advancements. Eventually, one or the other will reach the finish line first and the winner declared.

When a winner is declared, a separate image of the winner should be displayed.

When the user clicks on the winning image, the participants should move back to the starting line, the stop sign image should change back to a red light, and the winner image should again be hidden, just like when the page was loaded, ready for another race to begin. This may NOT be accomplished by reloading the page.

IF we didn't cover it in class DON'T USE IT. Google is a great resource, but it cannot be used for anything other than suggesting ideas. Any solutions, methods or techniques we have not covered in class so far will land you a zero. If you aren't sure ASK.

This project will reinforce your understanding and ability to utilize the following techniques discussed in class:

Referencing objects on a page using the browser object model
Trapping events (mouse click, etc.)
Creating/managing timers and intervals
Manipulating attributes of HTML elements using JavaScript
JavaScript variables
JavaScript selection control structures
